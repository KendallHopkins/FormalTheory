# FormalTheory

FormalTheory is a library that allows for manipulation and conversion of DFAs and Regular Expressions. Some of the features it includes are:

 - Regex Lexing (AST)
 - Regex to NFA conversion
 - NFA to DFA conversion (determinize)
 - DFA minimization
 - NFA/DFA has a valid solution
 - NFA/DFA print
 - NFA/DFA export as DOT
 - NFA/DFA string matching
 - NFA/DFA intersections
 - NFA/DFA unions
 - DFA negation
 - DFA to Regex conversion (basic)
 - Heavy Unit Test Coverage
 - Modern Autoloading Support

Coming Soonâ„¢

 - DFA to Regex conversion (complex)
 - Regex optimization
 - Generalized DFA solving based on positive/negative match list
