# FormalTheory

FormalTheory is a library that allows for manipulation and conversion of NFAs, DFAs and Regular Expressions. Some of the features it includes are:

 - Regex Lexing (AST)
 - Regex to NFA conversion
 - NFA to DFA conversion (determinize)
 - DFA minimization
 - DFA solution counting
 - FA equality
 - FA superset/subset test
 - FA proper superset/subset test
 - FA has a valid solution
 - FA print
 - FA export as DOT
 - FA string matching
 - FA intersections
 - FA unions
 - FA negation
 - FA reverse
 - FA to Regex conversion (basic)
 - Heavy Unit Test Coverage
 - Modern Autoloading Support
 - Regex optimization via rules

Note: FA is either a DFA or NFA

Coming Soonâ„¢

 - Regex optimization via mutations
 - Generalized DFA solving based on positive/negative match list
